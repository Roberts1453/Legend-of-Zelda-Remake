Comments:
	Most methods in the class, such as GetCollide, GetLocation, etc. appear to have low coupling since each method has no or few
	dependencies. Also, since most of the methods are short and carry out similar activities, it can be classified as having higher cohesion in some
	parts of the code too. 

	A hypothetical change to the game is which sprite is used for the GravelBlock when Draw is called. This change can be supported easily since the
	sprite the Draw method uses has not be coupled with the class and is instead determined by a seperate class, so no changes have to be made to the 
	GravelBlock class itself.
