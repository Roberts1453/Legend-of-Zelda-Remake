Maintainability:

Easy to understand add new sounds of multiple types. 
Simply add them to the dictionary of other sounds following the example of the rest of the sounds.
Methods make it easy for other classes to play a sound by simply calling the method with the name string as a parameter.

I was easily able to add new sounds and play the sounds from the item classes using this class.
