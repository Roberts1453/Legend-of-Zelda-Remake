Maintainability:

Good idea to have only one door class and an enum of the different door types.
Setting the door sprites makes sense. It may be a good idea to do the same with the block types.
I created a lot of class files for the different block types and it would be easier to maintain all of them
through an enum. Door.cs seems more maintainable than the other static block classes.
