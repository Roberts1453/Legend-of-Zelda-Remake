Comments: 
		The states are named clear enough so that the purpose of each state can be properly enterpreted. The variables that keep track of
	the states in the LinkStateMachine, such as the boolean variables LinkAttacking and LinkMoving are also named so that thier purpose
	is clear. White space is used to seperate groups of code, such as the different state methods in the LinkStateMachineso that individual
	parts of the code are more visible.
