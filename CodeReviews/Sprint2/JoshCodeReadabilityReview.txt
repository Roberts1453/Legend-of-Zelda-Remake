Readability:

The first part of the code is very straight forward and clear, with each state having it's own function and that function calling the sprite classes. I would say, however,
that while you state in the functions with using weapons which weapon is being used, it could be made clearer by also having the useItem function have names instead of
numbers. Directions should definitely be ENUMed since it's confusing even with the comment which direction is which. Using Boolean instead of bool, which is pointless,
though an easy fix and I'm only leaving it since I'm writing this code review. Since it's Boolean, I might be inclined to think that there is something more to it, affecting
readability. Everything before the Update function looks really good. The update function is a little confusing, with magic numbers being used for a time limit and the 
attackTime += gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds is non-intuitive. Again, more magic numbers with the linkDamaged timer. The rest seems good!

Other Comments:
The class is pretty long and only going to get longer, as far as I know most of that is unavoidable, but it would be ideal to cut it down as much as possible.
