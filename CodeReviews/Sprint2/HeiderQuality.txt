Comments: The quality of the code is very good. The naming of the variables makes sense and this file is
not ridiculously long. The Update() and Draw() functions make sense in this class
Suggestion: I do not think it is necessary to have idle sprite classes for each direction. I think there
should be one idle sprite for the down direction. I dont think that would take away from the game.
I think when Link or Goriya is not moving it is reasonable for them to just be idle in the down direction.
