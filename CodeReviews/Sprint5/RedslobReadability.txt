Comments: 
		The different methods delcared in the class all have clear names so that their purpose can be understood, such as RoomCondition and MatchPairedDoors. The variables that 
		are used by the methods also have clear names so that their purpose can be understood. While there are multiple nested conditional statements, they are clearly 
		positioned together and indented so that it is clear what condition multiple statements are part of.  Finally, sufficent white space is between statements and
		methods so that different methods or parts of the class can be identified more easily.
