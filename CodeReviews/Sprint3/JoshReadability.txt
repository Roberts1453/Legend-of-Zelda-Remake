Readability:

From the top, the active boolean is too vague, it should be replaced with isAttacking to avoid confusion. The following functions are very well written and leave no confusion 
about the meaning of any variables or what each part does. In have no issues with the Sword State Machine variables though the function BeMoving could possibly be named better.
The update function seems to be easy to read, however, the numbers for sword.location.x, etc. are pretty arbitrary and could be improved. Everything else looks great, very well written
with little complaints from me.
