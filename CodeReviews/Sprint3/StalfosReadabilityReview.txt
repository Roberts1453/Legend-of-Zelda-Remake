Comments: 
		The variables declared at the start of the class have names that show what the puprpose of each variable is. The methods declared in the 
		class, such as BeAttacking, MoveDown, TakeDamage, etc. are also named so that thier purpose can be interpreted from thier name. White
		space is used to seperate a majority of the groups of code. However, some parts, like the group of BeIdle, MoveDown, MoveLeft, etc. Are closely
		grouped together and could be spaced out a bit more to be more readable.
